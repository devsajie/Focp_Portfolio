# Python Weekly Assignment Portfolio

## Week 1: The Basics & Math

**File:** `Week1/Tasks.py`

* First Steps: Writing my first program using `print()`.
* Math: Using Python as a calculator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` for power).
* Order of Operations: Understanding how brackets `()` change math results.
* Handling Errors: Using `try/except` to stop crashes (e.g., dividing by zero). 

---

## Week 2: Variables & Data Types

**File:** `Week2/Tasks.py`

* Variables: Storing data (e.g., `total = 100`) and updating it (`total += 10`).
* Data Types: `int` (whole numbers), `float` (decimals), `str` (text), `bool` (true/false).
* Type Checking: Using `type()` to see what kind of data you have.

---

## Week 3: Logic & Loops

**Files:** `Week3/` (Various files)

* Comparisons: Checking if things are equal (`==`), greater (`>`), or less (`<`) than others.
* Conditions: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions.
* Loops: `for` loops to repeat actions a specific number of times.
* `while` loops to repeat actions as long as a condition is true.
* Control: Using `break` to stop a loop and `continue` to skip a step.

## Week 4: Using Modules (Math)

**Files:** `Week4/`

* Imports: bringing in external code using `import math`.
* Specific Functions: Using `from math import sqrt` to get just one tool.
* Math Tools: Calculating square roots, logarithms, and using Pi.


---

## Week 5: Creating Custom Modules

**Files:** `Week5/`

* Custom Functions: Writing reusable code blocks using `def`.
* Docstrings: Adding notes to explain what function does.
* Importing Code: Using functions written in one file inside another file.


---

## Week 6: Lists

**File:** `Week6/Tasks.py`

* Lists: Storing multiple items in one variable.
* Adding Items: Using `append()` (add one) or `extend()` (add many).
* Removing Items: Using `remove()` (by value) or `pop()` (by position).
* Sorting: Organizing lists alphabetically or numerically.


---

## Week 7: Sets

**File:** `Week7/Tasks.py`

* Sets: Collections that have no duplicate items and no specific order.
* Set Math:
*   Union: Combine two sets.
*   Intersection: Find items common to both sets.
*   Difference: Find items in one set but not the other.


---

## Week 8: Files & Formatting

**File:** `Week8/Tasks.py`

* F-Strings: The modern, easy way to format text strings.
* File Writing: Creating and saving text to a file (`w` mode).
* File Reading: Opening files and reading their content (`r` mode).
